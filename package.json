Additionally, the field automatically calculates the most readable contrast color. This can be useful, if you'd like to specify background colors and would like to adjust the text colors accordingly. The field displays the color contrast ratings AA, AALarge, AAA and AAALarge according to WCAG accessibility guidelines.",
